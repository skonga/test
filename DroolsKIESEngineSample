public class Account {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    // Other properties, getters, setters, and constructors
}


public class Transaction {
    private String transactionId;
    private String accountNumber;
    private double amount;
    // Other properties, getters, setters, and constructors
}

Now, let's define a few rules that could apply to these classes:

Rule 1: Detect High-Value Transactions

rule "High-Value Transaction"
when
    $transaction: Transaction(amount > 10000)
then
    System.out.println("High-value transaction detected: " + $transaction.getTransactionId());
end

This rule Ty triggers whenever a transaction with an amount greater than 10,000 is encountered and prints a message to the console


Rule 2: Apply Transaction Fee

rule "Transaction Fee"
when
    $transaction: Transaction(amount > 1000)
    $account: Account(accountNumber == $transaction.getAccountNumber())
then
    double fee = $transaction.getAmount() * 0.05;
    $account.setBalance($account.getBalance() - fee);
    update($account);
end

This rule applies a transaction fee of 5% to the account whenever a transaction with an amount greater than 1,000 is encountered.

To use Drools to load and execute these rules in a Java application, follow the steps outlined in a previous response:

Include the Drools dependencies in your project.
Initialize the KieServices object.
Load the KieContainer.
Create a KieSession.
Insert the objects (Account and Transaction) into the working memory.
Fire the rules.
Here's an example of how you can implement it:

import org.kie.api.KieServices;
import org.kie.api.runtime.KieContainer;
import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession;

public class BankingApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize Drools
        KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get();
        KieContainer kieContainer = kieServices.getKieClasspathContainer();
        KieSession kieSession = kieContainer.newKieSession();

        // Create Account
        Account account = new Account("123456789", 50000.0);

        // Create Transactions
        Transaction transaction1 = new Transaction("T001", "123456789", 15000.0);
        Transaction transaction2 = new Transaction("T002", "123456789", 2000.0);

        // Insert objects into the working memory
        kieSession.insert(account);
        kieSession.insert(transaction1);
        kieSession.insert(transaction2);

        // Fire the rules
        kieSession.fireAllRules();

        // Print updated account balance
        System.out.println("Updated account balance: " + account.getBalance());

        // Dispose of the session
        kieSession.dispose();
    }
}


When you run this Java application, the rules will be executed based on the data provided, and the appropriate actions will be triggered. In this case, the "High-Value Transaction" rule will print a message to the console, and the "Transaction Fee" rule will deduct the transaction fee from the account balance.

Remember to customize the rules, classes, and actions according to your specific banking application requirements.
